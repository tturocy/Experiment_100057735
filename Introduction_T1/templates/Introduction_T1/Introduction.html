    <p>
        Welcome to our experiment. Please read the instructions carefully because you will <b>NOT</b> be able to refer back to them. Your cash
        earnings in this experiment will depend on the decisions you take. It is therefore important that you understand the rules of the experiment.
    </p></div>
    <div style="padding:10px;", class="table-borders"><p>
        In this experiment, your earnings will be denoted in Experimental Currency Units (ECU). <b>50 ECU are worth £1</b>. After the experiment
        is over, we will convert the total of your earnings for the whole session into pounds and pay you through bank transfer.
    </p>
    <p>
        This part of the experiment is divided into <b>12 rounds</b>. In each round, you will have the opportunity to earn ECU by solving as many
        tables as possible within <b>40 seconds</b>.
    </p>
    <p>
        You will be presented with various tables including zeros and ones. You earn ECU for entering the number of ones within each table.
    </p>
    <p>
        In each experimental round solve as many tables as you can within the time limit. You will earn <b>10 ECU</b> for each table you solve.
    </p></div>
    <div style="padding:10px;text-align:center;"><p>
        <img src="{% static "Experiment_100057735/task_example1.png" %}" style="width:600px;"/>
    </p></div>
    <div style="padding:10px;", class="table-borders"><p>
        After 40 seconds, the task ends and the computer will inform you of the total number of tables you had successfully solved as well
        as your total earnings from the task. This is your income from your task.
    </p>
    <p>
        With your earnings you must decide an amount to announce, any announced earnings will see a <b> 25% deduction</b>, meaning
        that for every 10 ECU you earn, you must pay 2.5 ECU in deductions.
    </p>
    <p>
        To fill in the announcement, you have simply to provide your earnings. Given the amount of earnings that you announce, the computer will
        automatically compute the total amount of deductions you will be required to pay.
    </p>
    <p>
        Once you complete your announcement,
        <b> there is a 1 in 5 chance (or 20% probability) your announcement will be reviewed.</b>
    </p></div>
    <div style="padding:10px;text-align:center;"><p>
         <img src="{% static "Experiment_100057735/Income_Dec.png" %}" style="width:600px;"/>
    </p></div>
    <div style="padding:10px;", class="table-borders"><p>
        <b>If you are NOT selected for review:</b>
        Your final earnings for the experimental round will be equal to the amount of earnings you had made from the task minus the deductions you had on the earnings you announced.
    </p>
    <p>
        <b>If you ARE selected for review:</b>
    </p>
    <p>
        •If you are reviewed and if you announced your income accurately, then nothing further will happen; your final earnings for the round will be the same as if you had not been reviewed.
    </p>
    <p>
        •If you are reviewed and if you announced less income than you actually earned, then you will be required to pay the extra amount of deductions due. In addition, you will pay further deductions of 1 ECU for each ECU of underpaid deductions.

        After the review is completed, you will be presented with a screen that summarises the following:

            <li>
                How much income you earned by solving tables.
            </li>
            <li>
                The amount of income you announced.
            </li>
            <li>
                Whether you were reviewed or not.

            <li>

    <p>
        In short, each round in this part of the experiment will consist of three stages: 
    </p>
    <p>
        STAGE 1: You earn income by solving tables.
    </p>
    <p>
        STAGE 2: You announce your income and pay a deduction.
    </p>
    <p>
        STAGE 3: You get your final earnings, which depend on how your report your income and whether you were reviewed or not.
