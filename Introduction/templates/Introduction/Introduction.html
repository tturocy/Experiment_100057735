            This is an experiment in the economics of decision-making.  If you following the instructions
            carefully and make appropriate decisions, you can earn an appreciable amount of money,
            which will be paid to you shortly after the session.

            In this experiment, your earnings will be denoted in Experimental Currency Units (ECU).
            <strong>50 ECU are worth Â£1</strong>.
            After the experiment
        is over, we will convert the total of your earnings for the whole session into pounds.
        </p>
        <p>
        This experiment is divided into <strong>12 rounds</strong>.
        In each round, you will be presented with a series of tables containing ones and
        zeroes.
        Your task is to count and report the number of ones in the table.
        You will earn an <em>income</em> of <strong>10 ECU</strong> for each table for which you
        report the correct number of ones.
        A typical table is shown here:

    <div class="row">
        <p>
        Each round lasts <strong>40 seconds</strong>.
        At the end of the round, you will see the number of tables on which you
        reported the correct number of zeroes, and the total <em>income</em>
        you receive from these reports.
