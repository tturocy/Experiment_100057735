        This is an experiment in the economics of decision-making.  If you following the instructions
        carefully and make appropriate decisions, you can earn an appreciable amount of money,
        which will be paid to you shortly after the session.
    </p>
    </div>
    <div style="padding:10px;font-size:125%;", class="otree-title">

        Please read these instructions carefully because you will <b>NOT</b> be able to refer back to them
        after you leave this page.

    <div style="padding:10px;", class="table-borders"><p>
        In this experiment, your earnings will be denoted in Experimental Currency Units (ECU). <b>50 ECU are worth Â£1</b>. After the experiment
        is over, we will convert the total of your earnings for the whole session into pounds.
    </p>
    <p>
        This part of the experiment is divided into <b>12 rounds</b>.
        In each round, you will be presented with a series of tables containing ones and
        zeroes.
        Your task is to count and report the number of ones in the table.
        You will earn an <em>income</em> of <b>10 ECU</b> for each table for which you
        report the correct number of zeroes.
    </p>

    </p></div>
    <div style="padding:10px;", class="table-borders"><p>
        Each round lasts <b>40 seconds</b>.
        At the end of the round, you will see the number of tables on which you
        reported the correct number of zeroes, and the total <em>income</em>
        you receive from these reports.
    </p>
    <p>
        Your income is taxable and you will be required to fill in a tax return. <b>The tax rate on your income is 25%</b>. This means
        that for every 10 ECU you earn, you must pay 2.5 ECU in tax.
    </p></div>
    <div style="padding:10px;text-align:center;"><p>
    <h5>
    All Tax Income will be provided to the NHS.
    We will send details on the donation to participants shortly after the
    completion of this series of experiments.
    </h5>
    </p></div>
    <div style="padding:10px;", class="table-borders"><p>
        To fill in the tax return, you have simply to declare your income.
        Given the amount of income that you declare, the computer will
        automatically compute the total amount of tax you will be required to pay.
    </p>
    <p>
        Once you complete your tax form, the tax authority may choose to audit it.
        <b> There is a 1 in 5 chance (or 20% probability) your tax form will be audited.</b>
    </p></div>
    <div style="padding:10px;text-align:center;"><p>

    </p></div>
    <div style="padding:10px;", class="table-borders"><p>
        <b>If you are NOT selected for tax audit:</b>
        Your final earnings for the experimental round will be equal to your income
        minus the tax paid based on the income you reported on your tax form.
    </p>
    <p>
        <b>If you ARE selected for tax audit:</b>
    <ul>
        <li>
            If you reported your income accurately, then nothing further will happen;
            your earnings for the round will be the same as if you had not been audited.
        </li>
        <li>
            If you are audited and if you reported less income than you actually earned,
            then you will be required to pay the extra amount of tax due to the authority.
            In addition, you will pay a fine of 1 ECU for each ECU of underpaid tax.
        </li>
        </ul>

        STAGE 1: You earn income by solving tables.

    <p>
        STAGE 2: You declare your income to the tax authority.
    </p>
    <p>
        STAGE 3: Your final earnings for the round depend on how your report your income
        and whether you were audited or not.
