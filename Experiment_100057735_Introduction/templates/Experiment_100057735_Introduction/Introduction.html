    <p>
        Welcome to our experiment. Please read the instructions carefully because you will <b>NOT</b> be able to refer back to them. Your cash
        earnings in this experiment will depend on the decisions you take. It is therefore important that you understand the rules of the experiment.
    </p></div>
    <div style="padding:10px;", class="table-borders"><p>
        In this experiment, your earnings will be denoted in Experimental Currency Units (ECU). <b>50 ECU are worth £1</b>. After the experiment
        is over, we will convert the total of your earnings for the whole session into pounds and pay you through bank transfer.
    </p>
    <p>
        This part of the experiment is divided into <b>12 rounds</b>. In each round, you will have the opportunity to earn ECU by solving as many
        tables as possible within <b>40 seconds</b>.
    </p>
    <p>
        You will be presented with various tables including zeros and ones. You earn ECU for entering the number of ones within each table.
    </p>
    <p>
        In each experimental round solve as many tables as you can within the time limit. You will earn <b>10 ECU</b> for each table you solve.
    </p></div>
    <div style="padding:10px;text-align:center;"><p>
        <img src="{% static "Experiment_100057735/task_example1.png" %}" style="width:600px;"/>
    </p></div>
    <div style="padding:10px;", class="table-borders"><p>
        After 40 seconds, the task ends and the computer will inform you of the total number of tables you had successfully solved as well
        as your total earnings from the task. This is your income from your task.
    </p>
    <p>
        Your income is taxable and you will be required to fill in a tax return. <b>The tax rate on your income is 25%</b>. This means
        that for every 10 ECU you earn, you must pay 2.5 ECU in tax.
    </p></div>
    <div style="padding:10px;text-align:center;"><p>
    <h5>
    All Tax Income will be provided to the NHS. Evidence of donation will be emailed to participants shortly after all experiments are completed.
    </h5>
    </p></div>
    <div style="padding:10px;", class="table-borders"><p>
        To fill in the tax return, you have simply to declare your earnings. Given the amount of earnings that you declare, the computer will
        automatically compute the total amount of tax you will be required to pay.
    </p>
    <p>
        Once you complete your tax form, the tax authority may choose to audit it.
        <b> There is a 1 in 5 chance (or 20% probability) you tax form will be audited.</b>
    </p></div>
    <div style="padding:10px;text-align:center;"><p>
         <img src="{% static "Experiment_100057735/Income_Dec.png" %}" style="width:600px;"/>
    </p></div>
    <div style="padding:10px;", class="table-borders"><p>
        <b>If you are NOT selected for tax audit:</b>
        Your final earnings for the experimental round will be equal to the amount of earnings you had made from the task minus the tax you had paid on the earnings you reported on your tax form.
    </p>
    <p>
        <b>If you ARE selected for tax audit:</b>
    </p>
    <p>
        •If you are audited and if you reported your income accurately, then nothing further will happen; your final earnings for the round will be the same as if you had not been audited.
    </p>
    <p>
        •If you are audited and if you reported less income than you actually earned, then you will be required to pay the extra amount of tax due to the authority. In addition, you will pay a fine of 1 ECU for each ECU of underpaid tax.

    <p>
        In short, each round in this part of the experiment will consist of three stages: 
    </p>
    <p>
        STAGE 1: You earn income by solving tables.
    </p>
    <p>
        STAGE 2: You declare your income to the tax authority.
    </p>
    <p>
        STAGE 3: You get your final earnings, which depend on how your report your income and whether you were audited or not.
