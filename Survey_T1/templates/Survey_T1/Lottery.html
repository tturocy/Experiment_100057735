        In this part of the experimant, we will ask you to make a number of decisions.

     <div style="padding:10px;", class="table-borders"><p>
        The decisions we will ask you to make will be choices between pairs of lotteries. The table below illustrates the task.
    </p>
    <p>
        Each lottery can have two outcomes. The columns named Prob indicate the probability of each outcome of the draw, while the ECU columns indicate the value of the outcome.
    </p>
    <p>
        For example, in Decision #1, picking Lottery A means you have a 10% chance of getting 40.00 ECU and a 90% chance of getting 32.00 ECU; picking Lottery B means you have a chance of getting 77.00 ECU and a 90% chance of getting 2.00 ECU.
    </p></div>
       <div style="padding:10px;text-align:center;"><p>
        <img src="{% static "Experiment_100057735/risk_table.png" %}"/>
    </p></div>
    <div style="padding:10px;", class="table-borders"><p>
        If you look carefully, as you move down the table the probability associated with the high payoff rises for both Lottery A and Lottery B.
    </p>
    <p>
        In fact, once you get to Decision 10, you know that the high-value outcome for each lottery will happen with certainty. Your choice is therefore between 40 ECU for sure if you pick Lottery A or 77 ECU for sure if you pick Lottery B. 
    </p>
    <p>
        You must decide whether and when to switch from Lottery A to Lottery B.
        If you wish to play Lottery A in all Decisions, write 11 in the box provided. If you wish to play Lottery B in all Decisions, write 1 in the box. 
    </p>
    <p>
        Write a number between 2 and 10 in the box to switch to playing Lottery B starting with that Decision. For example, if you would like to play Decision A for Decisions 1 to 5 and B for Decisions 6 to 10, you should write 6 in the box.
