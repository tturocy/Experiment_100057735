         <p>
        In this part of the experimant, we will ask you to make a number of decisions.
         The decisions we will ask you to make will be choices between pairs of lotteries.
         There are 10 pairs of lotteries, as listed in this table.
    </p>
        <img src="{% static "Experiment_100057735/risk_table.png" %}"/>

    <p>
        Each lottery has two outcomes.
        The columns named <strong>Prob</strong> give the probability of each outcome of the draw,
        while the ECU columns indicate the value of the outcome.
    </p>
    <p> 
        For example, in Decision #1, picking Lottery A means you have a 10% chance of getting 40.00 ECU and a 90% chance of getting 32.00 ECU; picking Lottery B means you have a chance of getting 77.00 ECU and a 90% chance of getting 2.00 ECU.
    </p>
    <p>
        Note that as you move down the table, the probability associated with the higher
        rises for both Lottery A and Lottery B.
        In fact, once you get to Decision 10, that higher-payoff outcome for each lottery
        will happen with certainty.
        Your choice in Decision 10 is therefore between 40 ECU for sure if you pick
        Lottery A or 77 ECU for sure if you pick Lottery B.
    </p>
    <p>
        You must decide whether and when to switch from Lottery A to Lottery B.
        If you wish to play Lottery A in all Decisions, write 11 in the box provided. If you wish to play Lottery B in all Decisions, write 1 in the box. 
    </p>
    <p>
        Write a number between 2 and 10 in the box to switch to playing Lottery B starting with that Decision. For example, if you would like to play Decision A for Decisions 1 to 5 and B for Decisions 6 to 10, you should write 6 in the box.
